        <h1>The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc</h1>
        Snow White was still asleep, and The Handsome Prince was getting anxious.  Doc insisted that he needed more time to figure out how to remove the curse.  Until then, she would be left alone.  No kissing.  Doc’s orders.
        
        Unfortunately, The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc were worried.  The Handsome Prince was already buying fewer gemstones, which worsened if he didn’t get his kiss.  Doc argued The Handsome Prince had no right to kiss Snow White without her consent.  He also stated that The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc had no right to give Snow White’s consent while she was asleep.  
    Confused, The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc looked at Grumpy, who complained they were all becoming tree-hugging, daisy-picking elves.
        “The Magic Book says The Handsome Prince’s kiss will awaken Snow White,” Grumpy said with a frown and crossed arms.  Happy nodded.  He liked agreeing.  Sneezy nodded.  He wasn’t listening.  Bashful nodded.  He was too afraid to disagree.  And Dopey nodded, but he didn’t know why.
        “You are going to trust everyone’s safety to a book written thousands of years ago by people that considered dwarfs defective,” Doc said.
        As usual, The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc looked at Grumpy, who shrugged and called Doc “woke” and stormed off.
        For a long time, The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc stayed in the cottage and complained while Doc worked day and night to remove Snow White’s curse.  Occasionally, The Handsome Prince would visit, but Doc would send him away.
        One evening, when Doc returned from work, he found The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc armed with shovels, hammers, and pickaxes, ready to take back their Snow White.  He saw their fear and showed them potions that would protect them from the curse.  The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc looked at Grumpy.  Grumpy declared that no dwarf could be forced to drink a potion.  Doc agreed, although he could not allow any dwarf to approach Snow White without protection.  Grumpy considered this a moment and exclaimed the potions would make them sterile.
        “It's time to start kicking ass and taking names!” Grumpy said, and The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc threw down the potions and charged Doc.
        After leaving Doc lying on the ground, they went to where Snow White was laying.  They threw off her protective cover and took selfies with her comatose body.  The Handsome Prince rode up, grabbed Snow White's face, and gave her a long, awkward kiss, then rode into the woods, never to be seen again.
        The Seven Dwarfs Minus Doc wandered home, stepped over Doc’s body, and went to bed proud of their accomplishments.
